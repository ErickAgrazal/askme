# Askme (Preguntame)

## Brief description
This is a test project using MeteorJS. The idea is to make an app that can help with the process of the "Questions and answers" of an exposition, because it lets people to ask questions in real time during the presentation. I've tested it on an exposition about Ethical Hacking to kids from a Panamenian High school. Rigth now it is on a pre-alpha state.
